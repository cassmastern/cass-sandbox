Welcome to Ler's Demo Website!

The site's purpose is multifold:

- to brush up my knowledge of Amazon, GCP and Azure cloud platforms
- to concoct a quick technical documentation site for demo purposes (*see* details in [What's in Here?](whatsinhere.md))
- to learn something new in the process
- get the interviewer(s) to view this candidacy favourably ðŸ˜Š

> **Note:** This site is a living demo â€” an experiment space for writing samples, workflow ideas, notes on accessibility, and product concepts. Expect rough edges; theyâ€™re part of the showcase.
