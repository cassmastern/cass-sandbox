Welcome to Cass's Sandbox!

The site's purpose is multifold:

- to brush up and deepen my knowledge of major cloud platforms, Markdown, content architecture, networking, etc. 
- to play with some of the features supporting accessibility and eventually implement WCAG compliance
- to build up a technical documentation site for demo purposes
- to find things about 'what else I might be interested in'
- \[*inner voice whispering: "...and have something for job interviewer(s) to view, perhaps even favourably*] ðŸ˜Š

> **Note:** This site is in constant 'work-in-progress' mode â€” expect rough edges; theyâ€™re part of the showcase.
