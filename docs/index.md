# Well, 'Home' AND 'Welcome'  

Welcome to Ler's Azure-deployed Documentation Site! Its purpose was — as of August 2025 — multifold:
 
- to brush up my knowledge of Amazon, GCP and Azure cloud platforms
- to concoct a quick technical documentation site for demo purposes
- to learn something new in the process
- get the interviewer(s) to view this candidacy favourably, lol

## What's in here  

- a cross-platform (AWS, GCP, and Azure) description of cloud architectures 
- a comparative glossary of cloud/DevOps terms covering the platforms of the three cloud giants, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft
- other glossaries and cheatsheets I might end up using for work, for fun, or otherwise
- perhaps a non-traditional résumé with some references (under consideration)
