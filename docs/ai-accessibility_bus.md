# From Daydream to Concept Note: AI-Augmented Accessibility

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern technical documentation has embraced **automation and modularity** (e.g., reusable Markdown, generated diagrams, CI/CD publishing). Yet accessibility has not kept pace:

* **Visual content** — diagrams, flowcharts, SVGs, charts — remains largely inaccessible to screen readers.
* Even when ALT text exists, it is often **minimal (“flowchart of states”)** and lacks the **semantic depth** needed for real comprehension.
* Current documentation tools (MkDocs, Mermaid, PlantUML, etc.) offer limited or unreliable support for accessibility metadata.
* Authors face **high friction** : workarounds, inconsistent ARIA support, and testing overhead.
* As documentation scales, so does the **risk of inaccessible content** . This exposes organizations to compliance gaps (WCAG, AODA) and erodes inclusivity.

Accessibility today is often a **bolt-on** fix, rather than a **built-in** practice.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Introduce an **AI-augmented accessibility layer** that:

* **Detects** visual content across formats (Mermaid, PlantUML, SVG, PNG, Canvas).
* **Suggests** meaningful ALT and DESC metadata, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to use local glossary/context.
* **Integrates** into authoring tools (IDE plugins, XML editors, CCMS platforms).
* **Learns** from organizational style guides and past authoring decisions.

This ensures accessibility is **proactive, reproducible, and modular** — just like other parts of the documentation stack.

---

## 3. Value Proposition

**For Authors:**

* Saves time by drafting metadata automatically.
* Provides inline feedback and compliance checks during authoring.
* Reduces the cognitive load of remembering accessibility rules.

**For Readers (esp. sightless users):**

* Delivers meaningful, contextual descriptions of diagrams.
* Improves engagement and comprehension beyond bare compliance.

**For Organizations:**

* Reduces legal/compliance risk (ADA/AODA, WCAG 2.2).
* Scales accessibility consistently across large doc sets.
* Enhances inclusivity and brand reputation.

---

## 4. Implementation Roadmap (Incremental Approach)

**Phase 1 – MVP**

* CLI tool that scans Markdown and diagrams for missing/invalid ALT text.
* Integrates optional AI API calls to suggest ALT text.

**Phase 2 – Authoring Plugin**

* Integrates into the tools where authors actually work — whether that’s a structured XML editor (*oXygen, FrameMaker, MadCap Flare, Paligo*), or a docs-as-code IDE (*VS Code, IntelliJ, Sublime*).
* Provides inline suggestions for ALT/DESC content.
* Injects metadata and previews how a screen reader would interpret the diagram.
* Connects to the MCP Server for live feedback and glossary-aware generation.
* **Open Question:** Which platforms matter most? Techcomm tools vary widely by industry, from CCMS-driven XML editors to lightweight Markdown pipelines. More research is needed to identify the primary integration targets.

**Phase 3 – CI/CD Integration**

* GitHub Action or CLI validator for builds.
* Accessibility failures flagged like broken links or syntax errors.
* Automated reports with suggested fixes.

**Phase 4 – Metadata & Compliance Server**

* Centralized engine that enforces accessibility rules.
* RAG-powered glossary/context learning.
* API exposure for org-wide adoption.

---

## 5. Key Stakeholders

* **Authors / Technical Writers** – primary users; need low-friction tooling.
* **Accessibility Specialists** – validate compliance; reduce manual load.
* **Developers & DevOps Teams** – integrate into CI/CD pipelines.
* **End Users (esp. sightless readers)** – ultimate beneficiaries of richer, more inclusive documentation.
* **Organizations** – gain compliance assurance and reputational benefit.

---

## 6. Risks & Considerations

* **AI quality variance:** AI-generated descriptions must be validated by authors; risk of incorrect or verbose ALT text.
* **Integration complexity:** Existing doc toolchains differ; adoption requires format-agnostic solutions.
* **Change management:** Authors must trust and adopt the AI assistance, not see it as a burden.

---

## 7. Why Now

* Accessibility requirements are tightening (WCAG 2.2, AODA deadlines).
* Developer ecosystems are embracing **“shift-left” quality checks** (linting, CI validation). Accessibility belongs in the same category.
* AI capabilities are maturing to provide **context-aware, style-consistent text generation** .

---

**Conclusion:**

By embedding AI-driven accessibility checks into the authoring and publishing workflow, we can shift accessibility from a reactive fix to a proactive standard. This approach not only helps organizations comply but ensures that *all* readers — sighted or sightless — engage with technical content meaningfully.
