# Compound Modifiers Cheat Sheet

"Compound modifier" will be the only term from linguistics and natural language syntax in this topic. I'm including this as a pre-emptive exhibit of a weakness and yes, a cheat sheet. In plain English.

## Rule

> Use hyphenation for compound modifiers **before nouns** to ensure clarity and consistency. Avoid hyphenation when the phrase follows the noun.

### Hyphenate Before the Noun

### Notes

- **Adverbs ending in `-ly`** (e.g., *fully*, *partially*) typically **do not require hyphenation**:

  - Correct: fully automated system
  - Incorrect: fully-automated system
- When in doubt, hyphenate for clarity **before the noun**, and omit after.
