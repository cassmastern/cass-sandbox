# Glossary of OSS Terms  

OSS (Operational Support Systems) is one of the two essential frameworks in telecommunications. OSS focuses on managing network operations. The other framework, BSS (Business Support Systems), handles customer-related functions, such as billing and order management. These two systems work together to enhance service delivery and efficiency.

This glossary defines key concepts used in OSS, including service provisioning, fault management, and workflow orchestration. While OSS operates at a higher abstraction layer, many terms intersect with core networking principles.
