# What's in Here?

This site contains writing samples designed to remain relevant and useful for my own use and future endeavors, as well as some concepts/ideas. 

These include:

* a report on [How this Site was Developed and Deployed](about.md)  
  
* a page for bugs, issues and/or any kind of [feedback](feedback.md)  
  
* a rough [roadmap](roadmap.md) of what I want to do here  
  
* a series of articles on cloud platforms I hope to use in my next role:  
  
    *-* high-level architectures of the 3 popular platforms, [AWS vs GCP vs Azure](aws-gcp-azure.md)  

    *-* a comparative glossary of major cloud computing components across [AWS, GCP, and Azure](aws-gcp-azure_glossary.md)

    *-* a system description of a hypothetical [Jakarta Azure EE app](jakarta-ee-azure.md)

* a series of topics on contemporary networking and security:  
  
    *-* a generic topology of a [data center network](network_data_center.md)  

    *-* a topic on [STRIDE threat modelling](network_data_center_stride.md)  

    *-* a topic on [MITRE ATT&CK threat modelling](network_data_center_mitre.md)

* some glossaries and cheat sheets from past projects  
  
* a series of articles:
  
    *-* a 'technical memoir' about a coarse-grain Java project from the pre-cloud era  

    *-* a venting of current pain points while [trying to make diagrams WCAG-compliant]  (visuals-for-the-sightless.md)  

    *-* an idea grown out of the pain point above, about some kind of an [AI-augmented accessibility system](ai-accessibility.md)  

    *-* a [concept note](ai-accessibility_bus.md) grown out of the idea above  

No (or very little) late-night easy reading here.
