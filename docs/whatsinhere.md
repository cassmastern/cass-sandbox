# Whatś in Here?

This site contains:

- cross-platform architecture descriptions of the three cloud giants, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft  
- a comparative glossary of cloud/DevOps terms covering the corresponding three cloud platforms, AWS, GCP, and MS Azure
- other glossaries and cheatsheets I might end up using for work, for fun, or otherwise — in the near or remote future
- a report on how this site was developed and deployed
- perhaps a non-traditional résumé with some references (under consideration)

No late-night easy reading.
