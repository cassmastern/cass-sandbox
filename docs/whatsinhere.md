# What's in Here?

This site contains writing samples designed to remain relevant and useful for my future endeavors. These include:

- a report on how this site was developed and deployed
- cross-platform architecture descriptions of the three cloud giants: Amazon, Google, and Microsoft
- a comparative glossary of cloud/DevOps terms across AWS, GCP, and Azure
- a system description of a hypothetical Jakarta enterprise app on Azure
- a series of topics on contemporary networking and security
- additional glossaries and cheat sheets, such as those on OSS (Operational Support Systems) and computer networking
- a possibly non-traditional résumé with some references (currently under consideration)
- a final writing sample: a “technical memoir” about a coarse-grain Java business objects project from the pre-cloud era

No (or very little) late-night easy reading here.

PS: And yes, by the way, I was using em-dashes long before AI hackneyed them to death.
