# Compound Modifiers Cheat Sheet

"Compound modifier" will be the only term from linguistics and natural language syntax in this topic. I'm including this as a pre-emptive exhibit of a weakness and yes, a cheat sheet. In plain English. 

---
## Rule  
>Use hyphenation for compound modifiers **before nouns** to ensure clarity and consistency. Avoid hyphenation when the phrase follows the noun.

### Hyphenate Before the Noun
| Compound Modifier        | Example Usage                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `read-only`              | read-only file system                 |
| `high-availability`      | high-availability cluster             |
| `low-latency`            | low-latency connection                |
| `real-time`              | real-time monitoring                  |
| `fault-tolerant`         | fault-tolerant architecture           |
| `user-friendly`          | user-friendly interface               |
| `cross-platform`         | cross-platform compatibility          |
| `command-line`           | command-line utility                  |
| `open-source`            | open-source framework                 |
| `permanently-damaged`    | permanently-damaged disk              |

### No Hyphen After the Noun
| Phrase                   | Example Usage                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `read only`              | the file system is read only          |
| `high availability`      | the cluster supports high availability |
| `low latency`            | the connection is low latency         |
| `real time`              | monitoring is done in real time       |
| `fault tolerant`         | the architecture is fault tolerant    |
| `user friendly`          | the interface is user friendly        |
| `cross platform`         | the tool is compatible across platforms |
| `command line`           | the utility runs from the command line |
| `open source`            | the framework is open source          |
| `permanently damaged`    | the disk is permanently damaged       |

### Notes
- **Adverbs ending in `-ly`** (e.g., *fully*, *partially*) typically **do not require hyphenation**:  
  - Correct: fully automated system  
  - Incorrect: fully-automated system

- When in doubt, hyphenate for clarity **before the noun**, and omit after.
